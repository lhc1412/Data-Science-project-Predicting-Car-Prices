# Predicting Car Prices

In this project, I will practice the machine learning workflow by using self-defined function to predict a car's market price using its attributes.. The data set I will be working with contains information on various cars. You can read more about the data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile) and it can be downloaded directly from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data).

### Summary of results
In this project, I defined several functions to predict the car prices. The findings are following:

- For Univariate k-nearest neighbors model, the best feature is 'engine-size'and the optimal k value is 3. The RMSE is 2840.
- For Multivariate k-nearest neighbors model, the best features combination is 'engine-size'and 'horsepower', the optimal k value is 2. The RMSE is 2657.
